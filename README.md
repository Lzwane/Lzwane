### 🚀 Hackathon Highlight: Intellilearn-AI 🎓🤖

**Intellilearn-AI** is an intelligent learning assistant designed especially for students who study better by listening than reading. It’s a hackathon project that brings together several key features:

- 🎧 **Text-to-Speech AI** – Helping students absorb material through listening, with support for multiple accents.
- ✂️ **Summarization** – For learners with short attention spans or time crunches.
- 📊 **Performance Tracking** – So students can track their progress over time.
- 🧠 **Smart Reminders** – Nudges to stay focused and keep learning.
- 🎨 **Color Detection for Accessibility** – Helping color-blind learners engage better with visual content.

This project was built using a beginner-friendly stack including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask**, with AI integrations via **Google APIs** and other tools.
